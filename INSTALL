INSTALLING PGCROND
------------------------
As root from the same directory as this INSTALL file:
    ./install.sh

NOTES
------------------------
To install pgcrond on your system, run the provided install.sh script.
This will copy the pgcrond program to /usr/bin/pgcrond, create the
man page, create the /etc/pgcrond directory (and its child(ren)) as
well as create an empty /etc/pgcrontab jobs file. If you already have
an /etc/pgcrontab (from a previous version of pgcrond) it will not be
overwritten, though the sample pgcrontab from this version will be
copied to /etc/pgcrontab.dist (overwriting that file if it already
exists).

Once installed, you can start the daemon by running (as root):
    /usr/bin/pgcrond start

Because pgcrond is controlled using the same arguments as many init
scripts for more common versions of Linux and similar systems, you may
be able to add pgcrond to your startup and shutdown run levels by
doing something as simple as symlinking directly to the
/usr/bin/pgcrond file from the appropriate init directories on your
system.
