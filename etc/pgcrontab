# JOB DEFINITIONS
# In addition to the usual time and command fields used by other
# crons, pgcrontab offers several PostgreSQL-specific fields. The
# timespec fields works just like those of vixie-cron (refer to
# the documentation for the Perl module DateTime::Cron::Simple
# for details).
#
# server:      Hostname or IP address of the database server.
# port:        Port on which the database server is running.
# database:    The name of the database within the PostgreSQL cluster
#              on the server to which the connection will be made.
# user:        The username to use when connecting to the database.
# schema:      Comma-separated list of schema names to set in the
#              connection's search_path.
# type:        pgcrond supports multiple methods of performing a
#              job against the specified database. This field should
#              specify one of: direct, psql, perl or sh.
# commandspec: For types of direct or sh, this should contain the
#              actual SQL statement or shell command (respectively)
#              to run at the appointed time. For types of psql or
#              perl, this should be the path (relative to SCRIPTHOME
#              or fully-qualified) to a file which contains an
#              entire SQL session (for type psql) or Perl code (for
#              type perl). See the manpage for details on how to
#              properly structure such Perl code to work correctly.

# Job definition field order:
